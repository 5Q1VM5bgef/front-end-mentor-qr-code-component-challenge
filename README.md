## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Figured out that responsive design comes into play when the page has more than one coponent.

### Continued development

I realised that the most basic components of a page don't need to be responsive. What needs to be responsive is a behavior of **several** components.

Looking forwars for the challanges that will consist of several of such smaller cards/components that will need to be positioned responsively.

Since it was my first project, I decided to go easy on myself and use `px` instead of `rem` values. I'm looking forward to use `rem` values in my future projects.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tutorial â€“ Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXGznpKZ_sA) - 
I had to refresh my knowledge on how to load a font to the project and letter-spacing property in css.
